    "## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we built a structured, multi-step AI workflow for generating SEO-optimized articles using real-time web data and large language models. The workflow was implemented in three modular and composable steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information Retrieval via Perplexity**  \n",
    "   We integrated the `ChatPerplexity` component from `langchain_community` to fetch up-to-date, relevant content on a given topic. This enables the model to work with fresh and trending data, significantly improving the relevance and quality of generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structured Article Generation via OpenAI**  \n",
    "   Using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`, we defined a strongly typed prompt that produces content in a consistent and machine-readable format (`Article` Pydantic model). Company-specific metadata was incorporated to personalize and contextualize the final article.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Workflow Orchestration with LangGraph**  \n",
    "   We combined both steps into a single executable pipeline using `LangGraph`. With `StateGraph`, we clearly defined the state transitions and data flow, allowing the workflow to scale, remain testable, and be easily extended in the future (e.g., content moderation, post-processing, publishing).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this architecture, you can create dynamic, data-informed content generation systems that are modular, maintainable, and production-ready."
